# About the site
This website is intended to store random tech toughts and articles.

I also enjoy reading [books](/books) and wanted a way to store some notes for myself, that might interest someone else or not.

# About me
I'm Pierre. I moved recently to Zurich, Switzerland to join Deloitte's Cyber Risk team. My main focus and interests are identity and DevSecOps.
