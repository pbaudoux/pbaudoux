This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to easily turn plain text into a static website, and is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file (`md` for Markdown). After that, include the necessary front matter.

This command builds the website and serves it at http://localhost:4000/
{% highlight shell %}
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
{% endhighlight %}
